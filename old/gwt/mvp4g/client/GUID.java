/*
 * File: Math.uuid.js
 * Version: 1.4
 * Change History:
 *   v1.0 - first release
 *   v1.1 - less code and 2x performance boost (by minimizing calls to Math.random())
 *   v1.2 - Add support for generating non-standard uuids of arbitrary length
 *   v1.3 - Fixed IE7 bug (can't use []'s to access string chars.  Thanks, Brian R.)
 *   v1.4 - Changed method to be "Math.uuid". Added support for radix argument.  Use module pattern for better encapsulation.
 *
 * Latest version:   http://www.broofa.com/Tools/Math.uuid.js
 * Information:      http://www.broofa.com/blog/?p=151
