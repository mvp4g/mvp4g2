Mvp4g2 mainly helps you define 2 types of elements:

- Presenter (or Event Handlers)
- View

This page will help you to understand how to build these different types of elements.

#### Presenter
##### Creating a presenter
To create a presenter, you need to:

* extend AbstractPresenter<E,V>:
  - E: type of your event bus interface.
  - V: type of the view that will be injected in the presenter (normally a interface!)

By extending AbstractPresenter, you will have access to the following protected attributes:
  - E eventBus: instance of the event bus injected to the presenter
  - V view: instance of the view injected to the presenter

You can also override the bind method to bind your view to your presenter.

Mvp4g2 will automatically create an instance for each class annotated with @Presenter or @Handler.

* have a constructor with no parameter
* annotate the presenter with @Presenter and set the attributes 'viewClass' and 'viewInterface'

The 'viewInterface'-attribute will be used inside the presenter as reference for the view, where as the
'viewClass'-attribute will be used to instantiate the view. By default mvp4g2 uses **'new
[value of the ViewClass-attribute of the presetner annotation]()'** to create an instance of the view. (GWT-create()
will no longer be available in J2CL / GWT 3! And, to be ready for J2CL / GWT 3 we have to avoid using it).

If you prefer to create your view by your own, just set the 'viewCreator'-attribute to
'Presenter.VIEW_CREATION_METHOD.PRESENTER' and implement the ```IsViewCreator<V>```interface. In this case mvp4g2
expects a 'createView()'-method inside your presenter which returns an instance of the view, which - of course - has to
implement the 'viewInterface'-attribute.

Here is an example of a presenter which does create the view.
```
@Presenter(viewClass = ListView.class,
           viewInterface = IListView.class,
           viewCreator = Presenter.VIEW_CREATION_METHOD.PRESENTER)
public class ListPresenter
  extends AbstractPresenter<MyApplicationEventBus, IListView>
  implements IListView.Presenter,
             IsViewCreator<IListView> {

  @Override
  public IListView createView() {
    return new ListView();
  }

}
```

**Mvp4g2 will no longer inject services into your presenter!**

##### Multiple presenter
By default, a presenter will be created as a singleton, which means that you will have one instance of every presenter when the application starts. A multiple feature is available in order to allow developers to have several instances of the same presenter. When the multiple feature is activated for a presenter, all the instances of this presenter will have to be created manually by the developer (which means that no instance is created when the application starts).

To activate the multiple feature, just set the multiple attribute of the @Presenter to "true":
```
@Presenter(viewClass = OneView.class, 
           viewInterface = IOneView.class,
           multiple=true)
public class OnePresenter 
  extends AbstractPresenter<IOneView, OneEventBus>
  implements IOneView.Presenter {
  
    ...
    
}
```
When you have activated the multiple feature for a presenter, you can add a new instance to the event bus by create the
instance and adding the instnace:
```
OnePresenter presenter = new Presenter();
PresenterRegistration presenterRegistration = eventBus.addHandler( presenter );
```
You can also delete an instance of the presenter set as multiple by calling the removeHandler method of the event bus with the instance to remove:
```
presenterRegistration.remove();
```
![Attention](https://github.com/mvp4g/mvp4g/raw/master/etc/images/attentionSmall.png) Only presenters set as multiple can be added/removed. If you try to add/remove a presenter not set as multiple, an error will occur at runtime.

##### On Before Event
Presenters provides a method that will be called right before each event that it needs to handle: onBeforeEvent. The
onBeforeEvent-method has one parameter. The parameter contains the name of the event. You can override this method if
you need to execute any action before an event is handled.

##### Blocking Presenters
In some cases, you may want to prevent a presenter to handle events (for example, you don't want a presenter to handle events as long as the user is connected). This can easily be done by overriding the pass method of the presenter. This method is called right before a presenter has to handle an event. If the method returns false, the presenter is considered as deactivated and won't handle the event. This method receives as parameters the event name and the event parameters so that you can block a presenter only for some events.
```
Presenter(viewClass = OneView.class, 
           viewInterface = IOneView.class,
           multiple=true)
public class OnePresenter
  extends AbstractPresenter<IOneView, OneEventBus>
  implements IOneView.Presenter {

  public boolean pass(String eventName,
                      Object... parameters ) {
    if (!isUserLoggedIn()) {
      return false;
    } else {
      return true;
    }
 }
}
```

##### ShellPresenter
Inside your application you will have one sShell. That's the visiblearea of the application on your screen. Normally you
devide this area into header, navigation, footer and content area. Mvp4g2 expects one presenter which is defined as
ShellPresenter by adding this presenter to the shell-attribute of the EventBus-annotation.
```
@EventBus(shell = ShellPresenter.class)
public interface Mvp4g2MailEventBus
  extends IsEventBus {
}
```
The ShellPresenter behaves like a normal presenter but implements also the ```IsShell```-interface.
```
@Presenter(viewClass = ShellView.class,
           viewInterface = IShellView.class)
public class ShellPresenter
  extends AbstractPresenter<Mvp4g2MailEventBus,
                             IShellView>
  implements IShellView.Presenter,
             IsShell<Mvp4g2MailEventBus,
                      IShellView> {
```
The``ÃŒsShell````interface expect two generics:
* event bus
* the shell interface.
and forces the presenter to implement the ````etShell````method:
```
  @Override
  public void setShell() {
    // add the shell to the browser viewport (here GWT 2.x)
    RootPanel.get().add(view.asWidget());
  }
```

#### Event Handlers
An event handler is a presenter with no view. It can be used the same way as a presenter and has the same properties (except for the view).

To create an event handler, you need to:

* extend AbstractHandler<E>:
  - E: type of your event bus interface.

By extending AbstractHandler, you will have access to the following protected attributes:

  - E eventBus: instance of the event bus injected to the presenter

#### View
Mvp4g2 forces you to use the **Reverse View / View Delegate** pattern. THe instnae of the presenter is injected into the
view by the framework.

To create a view, all you need to do is to create an interface which extends ```IsLazyReverseView<P>``` and create a class,
which extends the ``LazyReverseView<P>``` class and implements the view interface.

For example the interface for the shell view looks like this:
```
public interface IShellView
  extends IsLazyReverseView<IShellView.Presenter>,
          IsWidget {

  ...
  
  interface Presenter {
  
    ...
  
  }
}
```
and the view class like that:
```
public class ShellView
  extends LazyReverseView<IShellView.Presenter>
  implements IShellView {

  ... 
  
}
```
