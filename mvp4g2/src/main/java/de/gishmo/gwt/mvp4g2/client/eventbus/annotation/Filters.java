// TODO update documentation
/**
 * This annotation may be used to set event filters for the framework.<br>
 * <br>
 * This annotation can be used only on classes that implement <code>EventBus</code> and that are
 * annotated with <code>@Events</code>.<br>
 * <br>
 * The annotation has the following attributes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>filterClasses: classes of the filter to use.</li>
 * <li>afterHistory (by default, false): if set to true, events will be filtered after the history
 * conversion. In this case, even if an event is stopped, it will still appear in the browser
 * history.</li>
 * <li>filterStart (by default, true): if set to true, the start event fired when the application
 * starts will be filtered.</li>
 * <li>filterForward (by default, true): if set to true, the forward event fired when the module
 * receives an event forwarded from its parent will be filtered.</li>
 * <li>forceFilters (by default, false): if you want to add filters dynamically and you have no
 * static filters (ie you haven't set any filter thanks to the attribute filterClasses), you will
 * need to set this attribute to true. Otherwise, when there is no static filter, Mvp4g optimizes
 * the code and removes the filtering methods (so filter(s) added dynamically wouldn't work as
 * filtering feature would have been removed).
 * </ul>
