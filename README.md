# MVP4G 2
MVP4G 2 will be the second edition of MVP4G.

In opposite to the first version of MVP4G, MVP4G 2 will not use generators, JSNI or the widget system. Instead it will use Elemental 2 and APT.

Moving to APT will cause changes, related to the options offered by APT. Using the ideas of MVP4G, MVP4G 2 will try to take as much as possible of the principles to the next version.

Currently, the basic event handling is implemented.

You can take a look at this small example, that uses APT instead of generators: [https://github.com/mvp4g/mvp4g2-examples](https://github.com/mvp4g/mvp4g2-examples)

**Caution**: This is only a early beta
